NodeJS Talk

Part1: A case for Nodejs and why we should use it more
Part2: Programming techniques to improve your code

My background:

Lead FE dev, but I’m not here to talk about FE, but BE
Use to be full stack, mainly PHP dev.

A paradigm that is getting a lot of traction here and everywhere are microservices.

We use a lot of different range of languages here at Sainsburys

- Language features
    - Python
        - Good for big data problems
        - Fast processing
        - Matrix manipulations
        - Machine Learning, Big Data
        - Lots of libraries
    - Go
        - Concurrency
        - goroutines
        - fast
        - very new
        - good practices not well defined yet
    - PHP
        - Easy to learn
    - Node
        - Build for the web
        - Async
        - Non-blocking
        - Highly scalable
        - Universal
        - Fast
        - Single-threaded
        - Exploding ecosystem
        - Specially good for micro services deployment with Docker, etc.

- The language of the web JSON. native to Node.
- But the most important for us should not be only these, the most important metric is how many developers can we get that are experts on these languages

- Myths
    - It’s a toy language/ it’s not production ready, it’s not widely used
        - Companies using Nodejs
    - It’s not fast
        - V8 is one of the fastest engines out there, faster than Python (and PyPy), and PHP, only topped by Go (since its compiled)
    - It’s too fragmented, micro modules
        - Depends on what you need to do, to write a standard micro service you only need 3 packages, a server (such as testify), a logger (such as bunyan) and a fetch/http wrapper/library (such as node-fetch)
        - npm has improved a lot not with flat file structure dependencies to avoid duplications
    - It’s difficult to deploy and scale
        - Perfect candidate for Docker because it’s single threaded

- Reason about
    - easy to read
    - easy to understand
    - feels more natural
