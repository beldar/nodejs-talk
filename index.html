					<h1>About me</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
					  I am a FE dev, but I'm not here to talk about FE, but mainly
						about BE.
						I used to be a full stack dev, mainly working with PHP for many years,
						CodeIgniter, Zend, Larabel a bit of Symphony, you name it.
						Since then I wanted to specialize on the FE since lately the paradigm
						has shifted heavely on do more things on the FE. But I found very difficult
						to get things done without a foot on the BE, NodeJS was the answer, it allowed
						me to prototype very quickly

					<h2>This talk</h2>

					<aside class="notes">
					  This talk will have two parts, almost with separate subjects,
						the first part will be about Nodejs, its strengths and clear some
						misconceptions around it.

						The second part will be around a couple programming techniques I've adopted
						which I find has helped me keep a more readable and clean code and avoid
						bugs from the start.

					<h2>What is Node.js?</h2>
					<p>
						<blockquote cite="https://nodejs.org/en/">
							Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

						<small>Note: V8 compiles Javascript into machine code on the fly</small>

					<h2>What is Node.js?</h2>
					<h3>Asynchronous and Event Driven</h3>
					<p>
						All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous that is, non-blocking. <strong>There is no sleep on Node</strong>.<br />

					<h2>What is Node.js?</h2>
					<h3>Very Fast</h3>
					<p>
						Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in code execution.<br />

					<h2>What is Node.js?</h2>
					<h3>Single Threaded but Highly Scalable</h3>
					<p>
						Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping.<br/>

					A paradigm that is getting a lot of traction here and everywhere are microservices.
					Joint together with the compartimentalisation of Docker and similar allows us to
					chop our services into a more stand alone units which also helps us to scale.

					We're breaking from the monolithic infrastructure. Another great strength of microservices
					is that are language agnostic, we can write them in any language we want, and we've been doing that.

					But when we choose a language we need to weight the main features or advantages of each of them.

					At Sainsburys we use a wide range of languages, I want to quickly go through what I think are some of the
					strengths and weaknesses of the languages are, and please forgive me for the the oversimplification exercice.
